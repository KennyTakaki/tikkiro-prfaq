# Five Questions
## 1. Who is the customer, and what insights do we have about them?
Our customers are individual investors who are considering investing in individual stocks.  
They read common market reports and analysis reports on stocks.
Investors who are considering medium to long-term investments and are thinking of holding for at 
least six months to a year or more.

## 2. What is the prevailing customer problem or opportunity?
These reports do not provide information on how much the stock price will rise or when to sell. When selecting stocks to purchase, they want to make their selection based on past price movements and the company's IR, taking into account these expectations.
Additionally, they wish to access information that supports these expectations, such as companies with similar historical price appreciation trends.

## 3. What is the solution and the most important customer benefit?
1. Receive recommendations on which stocks to purchase.
2. Be able to know how the recommended stocks will appreciate in value in the future.
3. Be able to present reasons for such appreciation based on the company's IR information and similar past cases.

## 4. How do we describe the solution and the experience to customers?
